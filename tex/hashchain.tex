\section{Hash chain}

Assume that $H$ is a secure hash function that maps a struct to a 256-bit.

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{hash-tree} is a data-structure composed of nodes called blocks. 
Every block $b$ contains a pointer $b.prev$ to a preceding bock and a field $b.h_{-1}$ 
that contains the hash of the block referenced by $b.prev$.
A block also contains a data item $b.data$.

The hash of a block is computed as $b.h_{-1}=H(b.prev.h_{-1} || b.prev.data)$

There exist one block $b_0$, for which $b.prev$ is empty. 

For to block $b$ and $b'$, if $b.prev=b'$ we say that $b$ is a successor of $b'$.

A \textbf{hash-chain} is a hash-tree, where every block has at most one successor.
\end{definition}

\comment{Image}

\begin{lem}
The blocks in a hash-chain can be linearly ordered according to the successor relation with the block $b_0$ as the first block.
\end{lem}
