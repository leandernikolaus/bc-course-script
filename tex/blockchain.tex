\section{Blockchain}
The following blockchain definition combines hash-chain with Merkle trees. 


\begin{definition}\label{def:bc}
A \textbf{Blockchain} is a hash-chain where the data entry in every node is the root of a Merkle tree.
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
	The blockchain construction was not invented for bitcoin. It is used previously in \emph{linked timestamping}, where block headers are published in newspapers.
\end{note}

\question{If the last block header of a blockchain is published, what is necessary to prove that a $D_i$ was data, included in the Merkle tree of the previous block?}
